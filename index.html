    <h2>Website Overview</h2>
    <p class="para1">My website is about tips and baits to use for the lakes, rivers, and the ocean throughout oregon. This website should help poeple who dont know what to use or where to go. I am going to be making pages about each lake, river, and ocean with a list of fish, bait, and rigs that work best with that body of water.</p>

    <p class="para1">Many of the lakes on oregon are home to smaller fish like Rainbow trout, bass, and bluegill. If you are just starting out fishing then lakes are a good starting place becasue there is less of a challenge. When fishing in lakes It is best to use bait like Worms and powerbait witch you can find in stores. When fishing in lakes most people use setups like a Bobber or just using weights. Fishing in lakes is mainly just sitting and waiting unlike the ocean and rivers where you are constantly doing something. Fishing in lakes Is the best Place to fish for beginners. </p>
